 Terraform Init (terraform init)
Purpose:
Initializes the working directory.
Downloads necessary provider plugins.
Configures the backend (if applicable) for storing the Terraform state.
Command:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform init
Example with AWS:
We will create an S3 bucket using Terraform.

Create a directory and a Terraform file:
sh
Copy
Edit
mkdir terraform-s3 && cd terraform-s3
nano s3.tf
Define the S3 bucket (s3.tf):
hcl
Copy
Edit
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-bucket-12345"
  acl    = "private"
}
Run terraform init:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform init
This initializes Terraform and downloads the AWS provider.
2. Terraform Validate (terraform validate)
Purpose:
Checks for syntax errors and missing required parameters in the Terraform configuration.
Ensures configuration files are syntactically valid.
Command:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform validate
Example with AWS:
Run the following command inside the terraform-s3 directory:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform validate
If there are no errors, it returns:
csharp
Copy
Edit
Success! The configuration is valid.
3. Terraform Plan (terraform plan)
Purpose:
Generates an execution plan by comparing the current infrastructure with the desired state.
Shows what changes Terraform will make without applying them.
Command:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
Example with AWS:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
Expected Output:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
4. Terraform Apply (terraform apply)
Purpose:
Executes the Terraform plan and applies the desired infrastructure changes.
Command:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform apply
Example with AWS:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -auto-approve
Expected Output:
yaml
Copy
Edit
aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket: Creation complete after 3s
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
5. Terraform Destroy (terraform destroy)
Purpose:
Destroys all resources created by Terraform.
Used for cleanup or deprovisioning.
Command:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform destroy
Example with AWS:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform destroy -auto-approve
Expected Output:
yaml
Copy
Edit
aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket: Destroying...
aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket: Destruction complete after 2s
Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.

Would you like me to extend this example to more AWS services, such as EC2, RDS, or VPC? ðŸš€
